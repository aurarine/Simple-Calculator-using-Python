<p>Today I was doing some exercises of while loops on Python, and decided to begin my first ever project....... A CALCULATOOOOOR.
Yeah I know... simple and easy, but since I'm a begginner I decided to do it, not using a single tutorial, only my knowleage of if statements and while loops (I didn't even add the while loops yet hahah). It's still pretty simple but I'm gonna start adding more operations (multiplication, division and maybe even some fancy things).</p>
